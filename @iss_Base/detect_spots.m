function [PeakPos, Isolated] = detect_spots(o,Image,t,c,r)
% [PeaksPos, Isolated] = o.detect_spots(Image,t,c,r)
% 
% find positions of spots corresponding to RNA detections in a b/w image.
% The input SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN TOP-HAT FILTERED (radius 3). If you
% want to smooth the image, do that first, this function won't.
% If you want to run it on generic images run DetectSpotsSingleTime
% works by finding local maxima and keeping only those where the top hat
% filter exceeds a threshold. 
%
% 
% 
% Also finds "isolated spots" for which morphological opening is less than
% a threshold. 
% 
% both thresholds are ABSOLUTE
% 
% Parameters (in iss struct):
%  DetectionThresh: threshold for top-hat filter when detecting a spot.
%  Default is 'auto', which means use o.AutoThresh(t,c,r).
%  DetectionRadius: radius of top-hat filter when detecting a spot (default 3)
%  IsolationThresh: threshold for morphological opening when determining if
%    a spot is isolated. Default is -DetectionThresh/5
%  IsolationRadius: size of opening filter (default 5)
%
% For now only works on 2d but should be extendable
%
% outputs:
% PeakPos is n by 2 array of coordinates (will be y first if plotting)
% Isolation is binary array saying which are isolated
